# notion2anki
Currently intended to support exactly one note format: 
- Two-deep nested bullets, where the top level of bullets are cosmetic labels and each chunk of sub-bullets is a cloze card, but with the "cn::" bit removed so I can just put something {{in brackets}} in notion if I want it to be a cloze and not have to count clozes
